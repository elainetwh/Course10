Overview
========================================================
 
The application was designed with the following goals Coursera
Data Science Specialization Capstone Project.:
  
- Satisfy requirement of predicting the next work given an input n-gram
- Ease of use
- Exploring different prediction algorithms

The Applied Methods & Models
=============================
After creating a data sample from source data, the sample data has been cleanned by conversion to lowercase, removing punctuation, links, white space, numbers and all kinds of special characters. 
This data sample was then tokenized into so-called n-grams. 

The aggregated bi-,tri- and quadgram term frequency matrices have been transferred into frequency dictionaries.

The resulting data tables are used to predict the next word in connection with the text input by a user of the described 


How the app works
=================
1. User inputs a word or phase.
2. The application will look for the last 1-4 words in phrase
3. The application will checks from the data table for word/phrases that match
4. The application will compile all the possible predicted words and displays the most likely one

How to use the app:
===================

* Classic mode: Type into the text field, and click the button
to see the predicted next word.
* Instant mode: Type into the text field, and wait. The app
automatically displays the predicted next word.
